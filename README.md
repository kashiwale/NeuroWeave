# NeuroWeave

**NeuroWeave: Where memory, thought, and intent converge to form intelligent, evolving agents.**

NeuroWeave is an open-source framework for building advanced, memory-aware autonomous agents using [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph), [LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain), and other LLM-powered tools.

## 🌟 Features

- Modular LangGraph workflows for evolving agent behavior
- Memory weaving across tools and tasks
- Scalable architecture for edge and cloud inference
- Experimentation-friendly with tracing, observability, and customization
